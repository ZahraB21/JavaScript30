        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        const team = players;

        console.log(players, team);
        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // team[3] = 'Lux';
        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // console.log(players, team);

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        
        // one way
        const team1 = players.slice();
        team1[3] = 'Lux';

        console.log(players, team1);

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team2 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team3 = [...players];

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        team3[3] = 'heee hawww';

        // with Objects
        const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;

        captain.age = 99;

        console.log(person, captain);

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 100 });

        console.log(person, captain2);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const captain3 = {...person};
